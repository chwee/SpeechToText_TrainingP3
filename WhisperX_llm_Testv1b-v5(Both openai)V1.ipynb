Is this a good time to talk to you? Yeah, yeah, that's okay, yes. You wanted my availability. Looking back, actually, previously, I remember now that I've met with someone from IPP previously, I think twice, and we went for coffee in Singapore and they explained financial planning and investments, portfolios and things to me previously. Would this be a similar kind of meeting? Actually, not, because I think you were approached by people not from the expat advisory group. The group flash department I'm calling from is called the expat advisory group, and specifically catered for expats in Singapore. I just checked your name in our database and you were not approached by expat advisory groups. So this might provide you with a different dimension, maybe different solutions that may cater to your situation. So if you're interested, maybe 3 p.m. tomorrow or 2 p.m. tomorrow is a free slot. If that's good with you, Philip, we can set a Zoom session for yourself. I'm happy to have a session, but it's going to be more of the same offering investment for share plans or bonds, things of that nature. It wouldn't be something I'd be interested in mainly because I've started investing elsewhere. But if there's other options there that I'm wanting to discuss, fine. I just don't want to waste your time or mine, that's all. Right. Before I just set your date, is there something specific that you're looking into? Maybe that I can let my consultant know and they can cater something specifically to something that you're looking into? At this point in time, I've actually just bought four properties in the U.K. and I'm looking to buy a couple more properties for investment. I also have a share portfolio that I've been investing in as well. The only thing I'm in the market for at the moment is to buy some insurance for life insurance really. But if there's something particularly interesting, I could look at it, but I'm pretty okay for investing at the moment. Because we do have something which really suits British nationals, South African nationals, Australian nationals as well. So maybe I'll keep that in mind. I'll let my consultant know and maybe we can have a short Zoom session. We can see the compatibility there and if it's something that you're interested in, we can have another session or we can see how things go. I'm always happy to have a chat with people, but I think this year already I've actually been contacted at least 15 times by similar companies wanting to have chats and I've entered in quite a few of them and each one's ended up where it's not something of interest. So I just don't want to waste your consultant's time either. But generally, people say, oh no, we have something very specific or tailored and then it's not. So I can't brush everybody with that credential. Sure, yeah. But if it's Wednesday, it can't be tomorrow unfortunately because I have meetings most of the day. But if it's Wednesday, then probably around about 4 p.m. is probably about right. Tomorrow 4 p.m. is what you're saying? Wednesday. Wednesday 4 p.m. Okay, sure. So what I can do for you is sort of send you an updated calendar invite for 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Then you can have a chat with our consultant and see if that's something that you're interested in. Yeah, sure. Okay, cheers Philip. I'll send you the updated invite. All right. I appreciate it. Have a great day. You too. Thank you. Bye.
