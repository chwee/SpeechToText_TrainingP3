Hi, Frederick, this is [INAUDIBLE] calling from IPP. This is a good time to talk to you. I'm about to get on the MRC, but I'm listening.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Yeah, sure. What can I do for you?\n","\n","Speaker 1: So basically, we're connected on the industry and number from and what we do here at IPB is we help expats here in Singapore with the wealth management planning. So we help them with tax efficient investment structures, retirement planning, university fee planning for the kids to go to the US or the UK even here in Singapore. And basically, your profile came across somebody we might typically help here in Singapore. I just wanted to check if you might be keen to, you know, speak to one of our consultants and see if we can be a potential assistance.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Why not?\n","\n","Speaker 1: If we send you a text on back to you tomorrow with a date so we could have a virtual group.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Sure, sure.\n","\n","Speaker 1: What I can do is maybe we can schedule a Zoom call on Monday. Are you free on Monday?\n","\n","Speaker 2: No, what about Tuesday at 4 p.m.?\n","\n","Speaker 1: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\n","\n","Speaker 2: 11 on Tuesday.\n","\n","Speaker 1: 11 we can do on Wednesday. Is that good with you, 11 on Wednesday?\n","\n","Speaker 2: No, I don't do that.\n","\n","Speaker 1: Okay. All right. What about Friday? What's your schedule like on Friday?\n","\n","Speaker 2: In the morning?\n","\n","Speaker 1: In the morning, Friday, anytime in the morning?\n","\n","Speaker 2: I need to 8.30.\n","\n","Speaker 1: 8.30? Yeah. Okay, so maybe I can send you a Zoom invite for 8.30 a.m. on Friday.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Okay, no way.\n","\n","Speaker 1: Okay, and then in the email as well, drop you some details as well. Let me try, but I'll try and I'll turn down to you because I think the next one that takes over on holidays.\n","\n","Speaker 2: I see. Okay, all right.\n","\n","Speaker 1: Uh, okay. Let's do one thing. I'll just drop your WhatsApp actually because it's hard to see it so I'll just drop your WhatsApp and maybe you can touch base from there, okay? I'll do that.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Nice, okay.\n","\n","Speaker 1: Cheers, sorry about that, mate.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Yeah, cheers.\n","\n","Speaker 1: Thank you.\n","\n","Speaker 2: Thank you.

Your task is to:\n","\n","1. **Understand the Content**: Carefully analyze the sentences in the transcript to fully understand the context and flow of the conversation.\n","\n","2. **Assign Speaker Labels**: Using your understanding of the dialogue, assign one of two speaker labels: \"Speaker 1\" and \"Speaker 2\". Ensure each sentence is labeled according to the correct speaker.\n","\n","3. **Handle Ambiguity**: If you encounter sentences where the speaker is not immediately clear, use context clues such as:\n","   - **Tone and phrasing**: Who is likely to say a particular phrase based on tone (e.g., polite, formal vs. casual, informal).\n","   - **Response patterns**: How the other speaker responds to or acknowledges a previous statement.\n","   - **Content knowledge**: Information or expertise that only one speaker might possess (e.g., a telemarketer explaining a product).\n","\n","   In highly ambiguous cases, make your **best guess** based on the overall flow of the conversation. Be consistent with speaker assignment throughout the dialogue.\n","\n","4. **No Strict Turn-Taking**: The dialogue may not follow a simple back-and-forth pattern. A single speaker may speak multiple consecutive sentences. Use meaning and flow to determine the correct speaker.\n","\n","5. **Output**: Provide the labeled transcript with correct speaker assignments.\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Example Output:\n","```\n","Speaker 1: I’m having some trouble understanding the service offer you mentioned earlier.\n","Speaker 2: Sure, I can explain that. We’re offering a special discount for our premium package.\n","Speaker 1: Does it include faster support?\n","Speaker 2: Yes, you’ll have access to 24/7 customer support with priority response times.\n","Speaker 1: That makes sense. I think I’m interested in signing up.\n","Speaker 2: Great! Let me walk you through the process.\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### Key Considerations:\n","- **Contextual Understanding**: Use the meaning of each sentence and context clues to ensure accurate speaker identification.\n","- **Handling Ambiguity**: In cases of uncertainty, make a **consistent and logical decision** based on the flow and content of the conversation.\n","- **Non-Alternating Dialogue**: Be ready to label consecutive sentences by the same speaker if necessary.\n","\n","---\n","\n","<<<\n","Transcript: {transcription.text}\n",">>>\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","dialog = run_groq(user_message)\n","print(dialog)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"72fd761f-3cf0-455d-8e75-502af96bb949","metadata":{"id":"72fd761f-3cf0-455d-8e75-502af96bb949"},"source":["**LLM  Audit prompts**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*Audit Stage 1*"],"metadata":{"id":"S1-uoGuyGq7C"},"id":"S1-uoGuyGq7C"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Stage 1 a\n","\n","example= [\n","  {\n","    \"Question\": \"-1.
